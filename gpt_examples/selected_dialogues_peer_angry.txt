Shouldn't you admit that you have something to do with Mr. Yu? You see what a photo of a student's graduation photo is? You're so close, you're laughing, you're laughing, you're looking at your eyes. It's a perfect pair!
左正鵬(surprise): 哎喲，麗華，照畢業相是學校安排的事，至於我和劉豔老師坐在一起照嘛，這也是攝影師傅安排的。本來我就不想和劉豔老師坐在一起照，怕你有想法，但師傅早就安排好了我倆的座位，他說我和劉豔是同學們的正副班主任又是科任老師，我和她坐在一起這是名正言順的事，所以就這樣拍下來這張使你極其誤會的照片！
Look, Lihua, it's a school arrangement, and I'm sitting with Mr. Yu, and it's a photographer's arrangement. I didn't want to sit with Mr. Yu, fearing that you might think, but the master had already arranged our seats. He said that it was a good thing that I sat with her because I wanted to take this picture that caused you a great misunderstanding.
徐麗華(angry): 你爲什麼和她捱得那麼緊呢？
Why are you so tight with her?
左正鵬(neutral): 這是攝影師傅要求我們這樣做的，他說要想照出整體效果，需要大家互相配合才行！
That's what the photographer asked us to do. He said that if we're going to get a picture of the whole thing, we're going to have to work with each other.
徐麗華(angry): 你倆爲什麼又笑得那麼開心呢？孫校長和張主任又不像你倆那樣地笑？
Why are you laughing so much? Why aren't you laughing like you two?
左正鵬(neutral): 在拍攝的那一刻，師傅叫大家笑一點，再笑一點，所以我們就這麼笑了。關於笑嘛各有各的表情嗎！
At the moment of the shooting, the Master told everyone to smile a little more, so we laughed a little more. Are there different faces to laugh?
徐麗華(angry): 啊！原來你們倆在表情，在互相傳遞愛情是嗎？
Ah! So you two are looking at each other and passing on love, aren't you?
左正鵬(disgust): 徐麗華這件事你要怎麼理解你就怎麼理解！反正我和劉豔之間是最清白的，今天我真是“秀才遇到兵，有理也是說不清”的事啦！
How do you understand Xu Lihua? I'm the cleanest person I've ever met, and I can't understand it!

徐麗華(angry): 哎喲喲，你還先發了脾氣呢！這不是做賊人心虛了吧。你自己好好想想，全班那麼多同學你隨便找個座位坐坐不就行了嗎，爲什麼偏要和那個女妖精坐在一起照不可！這不是我說你，就是再傻的女人看了都會覺得你們倆是不正常的事！
Why don't you just take a seat with that leprechaun? It's not about you, it's about being a thief, it's about being a fool, it's about you!
左正鵬(disgust): 徐麗華，明天你如果又跑到學校去找劉老師胡鬧的話，我真的要和你離婚了，我覺得和你在一起生活已經失去了夫妻的意義，到那時你別後悔啊！
Xu Lihua, if you're going to see Miss Liu again tomorrow, I'm really going to divorce you. I think you've lost your husband and wife in your life. Then don't regret it!

徐麗華(angry): 你別把“離婚”二次常掛在嘴邊。你別以爲我害怕和你離婚是嗎？真正離了你不一定不後悔呢！

Mom, don't worry about it. Jung-hoon and I will make it up to ourselves. He's a good man, and society thinks he's a man who understands emotions, reason, manners, manners. I don't believe that Bobo's bones don't contain his father's genes.

郭章建(angry): 什麼？你、你說什麼？讓我提拔小冬？開、開玩笑！我、我要有心提拔人，早就把、把那個姓陳的女人提拔起來了。不、不管怎麼說，她、她和我還有那麼一點、一點意思。讓、讓我提拔小冬？憑什麼我提拔她？哼！今、今天我、我實話實說。就、就我這點水平，和、和我們處的哪個人都沒、沒法比。所以呀、所以呀我不提拔任何一個人。我、我不能讓任何一個人，接、接近我這、這處長的位子。
What is it with you? Let me promote winter? Let me be a joke! I will raise the woman, and I will be a man, and I will be a man, and I will raise the woman, Chen. No, she, she and I have a little bit of meaning. Let me, let me, let me, let me promote her. Why should I? Now, and today, I, and I will tell the truth. So there is no comparison between me and any of us. So, I am not one of them. So I, and I, and I cannot let anyone, come near to me, and the chief of this place.
張萌(surprise): 難道，難道這個小冬也會威脅到你這處長？
Is this winter a threat to you, too?
郭章建(angry): “那、那當然了。小冬能幹，也潑辣。我能力是差，可、可我不傻。我、我怎麼會剛把姓陳的這、這隻虎從前門趕、趕走，又、又把姓冬的這隻狼從、從後門引進來。”一雙斜眼直直地看着張萌。
“That is certainly true. Winter is dry and hot. I am poor, but I am not stupid. I, and I, and why, have I just driven Chen, the tiger, out of the front door, away, and the wolf, the wolf, out of the back door.” A pair of square eyes looked straight at Zhang.

Why is this a picture of a man and a woman?
劉傑(neutral): 現在男的女的在一塊照相還不常見？
Isn't it common for men and women to take pictures together?
小娟(disgust): 你自己照一個多好，還有紀念意義。
You take a good picture of yourself, and there's a memory.

劉傑(neutral): 本來我就沒想照，她們說來了就照一個吧。我說我沒開票，她們說一塊照一個得了，省得再去開票，我就照了。
I didn't want to. They said they came. I said I didn't have a vote. They said they had one shot, so I didn't have to.
小娟(happiness): 下次我也去！，去玩去照相！
Next time, I'm going to take a picture!

Let's just leave them here.
順子(sadness): 咱們怎麼留下他們？就這老破房子。
How do we leave them? This old house.
韓長波(surprise): 那咱們跟他們出去？
So let's go out with them?
順子(disgust): 出去了你能幹啥？喝西北風去？你連地都不會種，外邊也不知道有沒有地種。
What can you do when you're out? Drink the wind? You can't even grow the land. You don't know if there's any land out there.

韓長波(surprise): 怎麼會沒有地種呢？他們不吃糧食？
How come they don't have land? They don't eat food?

Why do you think you're so big? You don't even have a pen. You think it's 350?
連國(neutral): 彆着急，彆着急，向大爺不是哪種人，我明天就去找他打欠條。
I'll pay him tomorrow.
張華(angry): 知人知面不知心，吃這麼多次虧了還記不住。看看向永那樣，是個過日子的人嗎？早晚把家裏值錢的東西全輸光了，到時候看拿什麼還咱的錢。
You know you don't know what you're talking about, you can't remember how many times you've lost. Look at Yong-seok, is he a living man? Sooner or later, you'll lose all the valuables in your family and you'll see what you can pay us back.
連國(surprise): 你怎麼把人都往壞處想啊？
Why do you think people are bad?
張華(disgust): 你別不信，你就等着看吧。十賭九輸，我就沒看到過賭博能發財的，只會越賭越輸，越輸越要賭，早晚傾家蕩產。

張萌(angry): 昨天晚上你一寫就寫到三點，原來才寫了個開頭？知道的說你是在寫一個小小的管理處的年度總結報告。不知道的還以爲你在寫政府工作報告呢。
You wrote three points last night, so you wrote the beginning? You know you're writing an annual summary report on a small management office. You don't even think you're writing a government report.

張心(disgust): 得了！我不需要什麼保護！又不是三歲孩子了！這套對我不受用。我可不會感動得熱淚盈眶。我累了，去睡了。
Come on, I don't need any protection. It's not a three-year-old. It's useless to me. I don't cry. I'm tired, I'm going to sleep.

You don't have to work, you want to eat rice, you don't have to do it!
左父(neutral): 穀子的質量好壞都無所謂的，你們只要把數量稱足就行了！反正人人都會老的。
It does not matter whether the grain is good or bad, but let it be sufficient for you. Everyone will grow old.
左正鵬(angry): 麗華，你這個不懂倫理道德的女人，對父母這樣不忠孝，今後會遭到報應的！
Lila, you unwise woman, who is so unfaithful to her parents, will be punished for this!
徐麗華(angry): 你們不勞而獲，比過去地主剝削農民還過餘！今後你們沒有好死！
You have earned more than the previous landowners had exploited the farmers, and you have not had a better chance to die from this!
左母(sadness): 正鵬，你不要再擢了，我們寧願少吃的，只圖個安寧的日子呀！

How dare you dance with a female teacher in broad daylight? They both meet on the head. They're hot. I'll be honest with you, you're not a teacher, are you?
左正鵬(surprise): 麗華，請你講話文明點好不好，我倆是在討論一道數學難題！你知道嗎！
Lihua, please be civilized. We're talking about a math problem. You know!
徐麗華(angry): 討論數學難題？她不可以和女老師討論嗎？爲什麼非得和你討論呢？前次你幫娟子那臭女人挑柴，今天你又和女老師在這裏低頭交談，你認爲我看不出來是嗎！
Can't she talk to a female teacher? Why did you have to talk to you? The last time you picked wood for that bitch, today you're talking to a female teacher. Don't you think I can't see it?
左正鵬(disgust): 你夠了嗎。我告訴你，口裏不要說髒話，有話我放學後到家裏去說。
Are you done? I'll tell you, don't talk dirty. I'll talk to you at home after school.

劉豔(angry): 徐麗華，你這個潑婦，到處惹是生非，你可知道這辦公室裏是我們老師辦公的地方，是文明的場所，沒有你說話的份！今天我和左老師是在討論一道數學難題，這是件十分正常的事，哪個單位裏沒有女同志和男同志在一起辦公！希望你放尊重點，不然你給我滾出去。這裏沒有你說話的資格！
Xu Lihua, you bitch, you know this office is a place for our teachers, a place for civilization, and not for you. Today it's normal for me and Mr. Left to talk about a math problem, and there's no place for lesbians and gays to work together. I want you to show some respect, or you get out of here.

I don't hate you, I just think you're being too unfair to me and Ziao Ming.
張心(angry): 公平？什麼叫公平？我所受的一切就公平嗎？我又做錯了什麼？爲什麼要這樣對我？
Fair? What is fair? Is everything that happened to me fair? What did I do wrong? Why do you do this to me?
張愛(angry): 這一切都是你自己造成的，你能怪誰啊？
You're responsible for all this. Who can you blame?

I'm not stung by chili. I'm just thinking about how to talk in that tone. The atmosphere at the table is depressed. What do you think?
楊藍(disgust): 我原本也很奇怪的，後來纔想到鄺野是在幫柯婕妤解圍。你沒看見何志揚總是看着她嗎？只是這樣一來，鄺野和何志揚恐怕是要面和心不合了！這傻子換另一種方式解圍不行嗎？爲什麼非要讓自己成爲何志揚的眼中釘？
It was strange for me to think that Tanino was trying to get rid of her. Did you not see what she was always looking at? It was just this way that Tanino and Ho were likely to have a problem with his heart. Can't this fool find another way to solve the situation? Why should he become a crucified eye?

連國(neutral): 咱有什麼好幫的，有吃的有穿的，日子又不愁。非要蓋洋樓買汽車啊？就是給咱汽車咱也開不了。安安穩穩過咱們的日子，一家人平平安安就是福氣。——睡吧睡吧。

Dad, what are you doing? Why are you so stupid? You broke everything in the kitchen.
徐父(neutral): 誰說我傻呀，“酒醉聰明人，飯脹癡呆子”，你懂嗎？
Who says I'm stupid, "Drunk, smart, edgy." You know what I mean?
左正鵬(surprise): 伯父，你快到牀上去躺着，休息下啊！
Uncle, go lie down on the table and rest!

Lefty, you still haven't left? Did you hear that, "I don't know what a real man is, I know what a rich man is." I'm not a real man, you're my daughter's "big man." Ha, ha, ha! Big husband, "the true man" is a good man.
徐母(disgust): 明天你自己做飯，反正廚屋裏沒有炊具啦！
You'll cook tomorrow. There's no cooking in the kitchen anyway!

Brother Ho, congratulations on your luck!
何志靜(surprise): 何志揚、交、什麼、桃花運了？
What's going on? What's going on? What's going on?
王若蝶(happiness): 聽說學校裏有個叫方豔莎的老師在追何大哥哩！這件事早就傳遍了！這鎮子纔多大啊？十有八、九的人都知道了！何志靜，你竟然會不知道嗎？
I heard there's a teacher in school named Fang Jingsa chasing Big Brother Ho! This has been a long time ago! How big is this town? There are eight or nine people who know! How can you not know?
何志靜(surprise): 是不是頭髮卷卷的，下班就是一身時尚打扮的那個女孩？
Is it hair curls? Is that the girl who's dressed up at work?
王若蝶(surprise): 對就是她！我就覺得奇怪，這件事早就在鎮上傳遍了。你怎麼會……
Yeah, that's her. I'm surprised it's all over town. How did you...
何志靜(happiness): 原來真是她啊！難怪最近兩個多月來，她總往我店裏跑還套近乎。我就覺得很奇怪！她爲什麼總找一個女人！原來是想做我的嫂子啊！
That's why she's been running into my shop for the last two months. I find it strange why she's always looking for a woman! She wants to be my sister-in-law!
何志靜(disgust): 何志揚，你給我聽清楚了，如果你敢跟她交往，我一定湊扁你！
Ho Chiong, listen to me. If you go out with her, I'll beat you up!
$$$$$

何志揚(disgust): 做什麼嫂子？何志靜，你不要亂說話好不好？她追我是她的事！總之我又沒追她！何況她是城里人，父親又是教育局辦公室主任，她的家庭是我這種人高攀得起的嗎？王若蝶，以後這樣的話不要隨便說了！
Sister-in-law, why don't you talk to her? She's chasing me. I'm not chasing her. She's from the city, and her father is the head of the Department of Education's office. Is her family a man like me?
王若蝶(happiness): 其實也不能怪何大哥！他是市裏評選出的優秀教師，又是學校的教研主任，以後還有可能成爲學校的校長。待人又是那麼的溫和。有女孩子主動追求也是很正常的啊！如果換成是我也可能這樣做的。
It's not so bad. He's a good teacher, a school director, and he's probably the school director. He's so gentle. It's normal for a girl to go after her. I would have done the same thing.
秦延(happiness): 小丫頭，你還真是花心啊。
Little girl, you're such a waste of time.
王若蝶(happiness): 我是打比方而已。我只喜歡鄺大哥！雖然他有了言鳳姐，但我還是喜歡他！
I'm just a metaphor. I only like Brother Yu. He's got her, but I still like her!

Yuan Ying, you mean woman has no right to call her my name! Seven years ago, your heart let you go. I didn't know you'd been thinking about it for seven years, but you've been anxious to get back at her! If Wang is so young, you'll ruin her!

My dear, who do I think is the idol in your heart?
左正鵬(surprise): 楊偉，你怎麼這樣說話呢！我們同學之間在這裏說說話有什麼不可以的，你心底也太狹窄了。
Yang Wei, what is the matter with you? Why can't we talk here? Your heart is too narrow.
楊偉(disgust): 這不是我心底狹窄，而是你們倆心裏有“鬼”！左正鵬，我要忠告你：你是有妻之夫，不要勾引別的女人，你想學習“陳世美”是嗎？
This is not a narrow heart, but a ghost in your hearts. I advise you: you are a married man. Don't seduce other women. Do you want to learn about Chen Se Mi?
左正鵬(surprise): 楊偉，你在胡說什麼！請你說話注意點方法，不要傷了我們的和氣！
Yang Wei, what are you talking about?
劉豔(angry): 楊偉同學，請你用詞準確點。“勾引”這個貶義詞用在你的身上是最恰當的了。再說，誰在“勾引”誰，你是最清楚的！
Mr. Yang, be precise in your words. The word "trading" is the most appropriate word on you. And you know best who's "trading" who is.
楊偉(disgust): 劉豔同學，破壞別人家庭的人是不道德的你知道嗎？左正鵬是有妻之人，並且還有了孩子，難道你還不知道？
It's immoral for someone who destroys another's family. Do you know that he has a wife and a child? Don't you know that?

If I don't give it to Director Chen, I don't care about the school, because I'm the only one who knows about your money transfer to Yang Gou County, and you signed it as an entire student in our Chinese school, and I'm a member of the Chinese school. Of course, I have the right to ask about it.

Sister, the guy at the new fashion store said he's coming with us on the River Sufin.
亞琳(surprise): 幹啥，他要作俄羅斯的服裝？
What, he's going to make Russian costumes?
亞玲(neutral): 可能吧，他說去看看再說。
Maybe. He said he'd check it out.
亞琳(fear): 去唄，正好，咱們還有個伴兒。不過，可別讓他撬了咱們的行。
Come on, that's right. We've got company. But don't let him break into our business.
亞玲(happiness): 不會，他是作服裝的。
No, he's a dresser.
亞琳(disgust): 那啥不能作呀？誰規定的他只能作服裝不作別的？
What can't be done? Who's to say he's to be dressed and not to be anything else?

亞玲(happiness): 要我看，要是服裝好作，咱們也可以作服裝呀。
Let me see, if we dress well, we can dress well.
亞琳(fear): 那可不行，咱們經營的是小百貨，沒有服裝，你沒看那執照上是咋寫的嗎？超範圍經營可是要罰款的呀。
That's not true. We're running a department store with no costumes. Don't you see what that says on the license? It's a fine.
亞玲(happiness): 把執照改一改不就得了！那天他來說了去綏芬河的事以後我就想，咱們爲啥非在一棵樹上吊死？咱們除了小百貨爲啥就不能乾點別的？賣點服裝不也是現成的嗎？
Why can't we just hang ourselves on a tree? Why can't we just do something else? Aren't some clothes ready to be sold?

劉豔(neutral): 今年的高考試題難度大嗎？
Is this year's high school test difficult?
左正鵬(neutral): 難度不太大，都是些基礎東西，問題是我們丟久了，又沒有很好去複習。你想到沒有，我們這些老三屆高中生，知識掌握得蠻牢固的，那些文革期的高中生，他們的知識能和我們比嗎？所以，我們也應該自信點，你說是嗎？
It's not that hard, it's just basic stuff. The problem is that we've been lost for a long time, and we're not doing a good job of studying. Do you think, we seniors in high school, we have a solid knowledge, and those in high school in the arts, can they compare with us? So we should be confident, too, right?
劉豔(neutral): 是，是，你把我的心說的癢癢的。明年我一定也要揮戈上陣試試，否則，枉了我讀書人的十年寒窗時間。

張萌(surprise): 處室的工作總結報告處長不寫憑什麼讓你寫？
Why don't you write the desk director's summary report?
郭章建(neutral): 這你就不懂了。處長讓我寫這個總結報告，這可是看得起我才讓我寫的。再說了，這也是一種變相的培養。也是一個要提拔我的小信號。
That's what you don't understand. The director asked me to write this summary report, and that's what I'm writing. Besides, it's a different form of upbringing. It's also a little signal to promote.

That's what I'm going to say. Let's leave it here today. You'll marry yourself. Don't act like someone's got a knife on your neck!

I met Zi Ming when I was in school.
張心(neutral): 難怪！我說呢，爸媽怎麼會放心你和他交往。原來上學就在打基礎了。
That's why I'm telling you, Mom and Dad don't worry about you dating him. You're starting school.
張愛(fear): 什麼呀！哦，對了，這次事情解決了我幫你找份工作吧！別再去那種地方工作了，不安全。
Oh, by the way, I'll get you a job. Don't go to that place again. It's not safe.

Look again. But thank you for your kindness.

張愛(fear): 要不要去醫院檢查一下啊？
Why don't you go to the hospital and check it out?
張心(neutral): 不用了！可能是在酒吧工作熬夜的原故吧！休息幾天把時間倒過來就沒事了。
No, I'm sure it's because I've been working all night in a bar. I'll be fine when I take a few days off.
張愛(neutral): 那你休息吧！不打擾你了。明天還要去救那個劉輝呢！
Get some rest. I won't bother you. I'm going to save the baby tomorrow.

When I went to the company today, I didn't know who had changed my papers to some comics, so I came back and found them in her drawer. I asked her, and she was like taking explosives, worse than anyone else!

Is that right? Is that what you're saying? What you're saying is that I took your file!

What are you doing? Put your clothes on. How many times have I told you, you're still doing this.
劉豔(sadness): 正鵬，就這一次行嗎？
Jung-ho, will you do it this time?
左正鵬(surprise): 不行！絕對不行！我如果答應了，你還會有第二次。再說我這樣做對不起我的妻子！
No way! If I say yes, you'll do it again. And I'm sorry for my wife!

Today, although it has been written for one day, it has not been possible to write a few words.
張萌(surprise): 那是爲什麼？

郭章建(sadness): 別提了。辦公室別的人時不時地盡跟我瞎搗亂。
Don't mention it. Everyone else in the office is messing with me from time to time.
張萌(surprise): 搗亂？你在工作，別人在一旁搗亂？
Disruption? You're working. Someone else is messing around?
郭章建(neutral): 那倒不是。主要是我不想讓他們，尤其是徐處長，知道我一直在寫處裏的總結報告。
That's not true. It's because I don't want them, especially Chief Seo, to know that I've been writing a summary report.
張萌(neutral): 知道就知道唄。知道了又能怎麼樣？
We'll know. What if we know?
郭章建(disgust): 這你就不懂了。讓徐處長知道我一直在寫處裏的總結報告，他總會認爲我工作能力差文筆水平低，一個總結報告寫好幾天還寫不完。要是讓別人知道我一直在寫處裏的總結報告，他們又會打聽我在總結報告裏對他們的工作成績提沒提？對他們在工作中的失誤提沒提？總之麻煩得很！
You don't understand that. Let Xu know that I've been writing the summary report in the office, and he'll always think that I have a low level of ability to work, and that a summary report can't be written for days. If anyone knows I've been writing the summary report in the office, they'll ask me if I've mentioned their work in the summary report.

Why not? Everyone has a right to know. It's a lie to everyone. It's not fair to everyone.
張心(angry): 那你的意思是還要告訴你爸媽，還有所有不知道這事的人這纔算公平了？那乾脆把這事弄成宣傳單貼到大街上去嘛！這樣就公平了，不是嗎？
So you're saying it's fair to tell your parents and everyone else who doesn't know about this? So why don't you just put it on the street and put it in a bill? That's fair, isn't it?

Mother-in-law, look, it's only been a few days since I've been home, and Lila is angry with me. You take care of her every day, and it's hard to serve her.
左母(sadness): 親家母，你看，徐妹子好端端的一個人，一下子就變成了殘疾人了，怪可憐的，真是活受罪呀！
Mother and father, you're such a good girl. You've become a cripple. Poor thing.
徐母(neutral): 是呀！這都是命中註定的事，誰也沒辦法，啊！對了，麗華這件事你們告訴正鵬了嗎？我覺得還是告訴他好些。
Yes, it is a matter of fate, and no one can. Have you told Jung-hoon about Li-hua? I think it is better to tell him.
左母(neutral): 原先我也是這麼想的。後來我又想，即使正鵬回了家也幫不了多大的忙，相反的還耽誤了他的學習。所以，就沒有告訴他了！反正沒多久他放暑假要回家的。
That's what I thought. And then I thought, even if I was going home, I wouldn't do much to help, but I delayed his studies. So I didn't tell him. He didn't come home for the summer.

How else can you say that you women have short-haired hair? I mean big, that's investment. Do you understand? You see, Chief Seo's retirement, and who's going to run this place, the key is this necklace. What is this little necklace if I'm the manager of the administration?

張萌(fear): 你的意思我明白了。不過萬一你接不了他的位子，那我們可就虧大了。
I see what you mean. But if you fail to take his place, then we will be great losers.
郭章建(neutral): 你的擔心也不能說就沒有道理。這也是沒有辦法的辦法。你想想看，做生意投資有沒有風險？有，肯定有。任何事情都是有風險的。不過從目前各方面的情況看，我估摸着應該問題不大。
Your fears can't be justified. There's no way to do that. Think about it. Is there a risk in investing in business? Yes, there is. Anything is a risk. But from the current situation, I don't think there's a problem.
張萌(fear): 我把話先給你說清楚。要是萬一你的事情沒成，你得想辦法把失去的損失給我補回來。
Let me make this clear to you first. If it doesn't work out, you have to find a way to make up for the loss.
郭章建(disgust): 你呀你！眼界太小。走吧。
You're too small for that. Let's go.
$$$$$

張萌(surprise): 幹什麼去？
What are you doing?
郭章建(neutral): 去給徐處長送項鍊呀。
Go and deliver the necklace to Chief Seo.
張萌(surprise): 你自己送去就行了。我去幹嗎呀？
Just take it yourself. What am I supposed to do?
郭章建(neutral): 這你就又不明白了。咱不能說這項鍊是特意買的。一這樣說人家就是想收也不好收了。咱得說是有親戚從南方回來了。聽說那裏的首飾價格便宜，東西又好。正好徐處長的女兒結婚，咱們就讓親戚給帶回來一條。
And you don't understand that. We can't say that this necklace was bought on purpose. That's why they want it. We have relatives coming back from the south. They say the jewelry is cheap and the goods are good. Just as Xu's daughter is married, let's get her back.
張萌(surprise): 那也用不着非得我和你一起去呀。
It doesn't have to be me with you.
郭章建(neutral): 我一個大男人，有的話不好說。有你在，有的話你就替我說了。再說咱們兩人一起去不是顯得咱們和徐處長更親近嗎？記着啊，到時候說話可得靈活一點。
I'm a big man, and I can't say anything. If you're there, you can say it for me. Besides, if we go together, we'll be closer to Xu. Remember, we'll talk better.
張萌(neutral): 就你的鬼心眼多。
You've got a lot on your mind.

You see, as soon as I tell you about this, you laugh.
連軍(neutral): 暫時還沒這個想法。
That's not the idea yet.
連國(disgust): 你也30出頭了，總不能就這樣一個人過下去吧？咱爹媽死的早，長兄爲父，我不操心誰操心？爹媽要活着還不得把我罵死。
You're 30 years old. You can't live alone. My parents died early. My older brother and father.

連軍(neutral): 還不急，我想把店面搞大點，多賺點錢，要不怎麼養活老婆孩子？
It's not too late. I'd like to make more money in the shop. Why don't you feed my wife and kids?
連國(neutral): 我和你嫂子結婚的時候家裏窮的叮噹響，還不一樣過日子、養孩子。
When I married your sister-in-law, I had a poor twilight in my family, and I had a different life and a child.
連軍(neutral): 時代不一樣了。
Times are different.
連國(neutral): 時代再變，這該結婚還得結婚。錢應該賺，這老婆也應該找，兩者不衝突。錢夠花就行，要多少是多啊？
It's time to get married again. It's time to get married. The money should be earned, the wife should be found, and there's no conflict between the two. If the money's enough, how much will it cost?
連軍(neutral): 結婚不得要錢嗎？
Don't you need money to get married?
連國(neutral): 缺錢了？缺錢了和我說，砸鍋賣鐵我支持你。
You need money? You need money. Tell me, I'm on your side.
連軍(neutral): 我不是那意思，關鍵是，沒目標啊。
I didn't mean that. The point is, there's no target.
連國(neutral): 把眼光放低點，別那麼高的要求，人品要好，家庭條件要好，長相要好，哪有那麼十全十美的。差不多就行了。實在找不到目標讓你嫂子給你介紹幾個。
Keep your eyes down, don't be so demanding, be nice, have a nice family, look good, have a perfect look. That's all. I can't find a goal for your sister-in-law to introduce you to.
連軍(happiness): 行了，咱不說這個了，喝酒。
All right, let's not talk about this. Drink.
連國(neutral): 跟我裝好漢？你喝多少酒我能不知道？我可跟你說好了，我再給你一點時間，到年底，你要再不到對象，我從大街上隨便給你抓個來。
Why don't you tell me how many drinks you've had? I told you, I'll give you a little more time. At the end of the year, if you don't get another one, I'll pick you up from the street.
連軍(happiness): 行行行，我保證給你領回來一個，行了吧？
Come on, I promise I'll get one for you, okay?

So who has nothing to do with him? I told you Chen Ming, I'm afraid that you're all looking at her. So what if you're all looking at her? She's a liar! She's a liar now! She's lying to you all about your sympathy. I've seen it through! What is the matter with you? I don't believe!
陳子明(angry): 你說夠了沒有？

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
何志靜(angry): 何志揚，你是個男人嗎？竟然動手打女人！知道錯了就應該當面向她道歉，而不是沒出息的獨自喝悶酒！我最恨男人打女人了！何志揚，若不是媽在的話，我真想踹你一腳。
Ho Chiong, are you a man? Do you hit a woman? If you know you're wrong, you should apologize to her instead of drinking alone. I hate men who beat women. If it wasn't for Mom, I'd really like to kick your ass.
黃梅(fear): 志靜，你就不要說了！快點和我一起扶你哥回房。他凍了一晚還不知道有沒有生病？

Chen, it's okay. I'm talking to my lover. Well, the old king's business has spread out. Great. Then you can do another job and make it more effective. You don't want to think that old Xu is still the manager of the administration, and that the old king is responsible for what's going on. Right, we're talking about it.

Ho, that stupid kid Ji-young made himself look like that to me. Do you think we should ask her what she thinks? She doesn't know she likes her because she's smart!
何建(neutral): 以前他們有說有笑，有時候也一起出門，可是這段時間他們倆好像都變了。變得幾乎像是陌生人了。至於你說志揚喜歡婕妤，這個我倒還沒看出來。
They used to laugh and sometimes go out together, but they both seemed to have changed this time. They almost became strangers. As far as you're concerned, I don't see it.
黃梅(disgust): 你真是個呆子！你這父親是怎麼當的？兒子喜歡誰你都看不出來！不行！我得去問問婕妤。
You're a fool! What did you do to your father? You can't see who your son likes? No! I have to ask him.
$$$$$

何建(disgust): 你都是幾十歲的人了，怎麼老是沉不住氣？孩子們的事情就讓他們自己去解決。如果婕妤心裏沒有志揚，你這一問不是弄得大家臉上都不好看嗎？這以後的日子還咋過？
You're ten years old. Why can't you stay calm? Let them solve the problems of the children themselves. If there is no will in your heart, don't you make it look bad on everyone's face? What will happen next?

Yeah, I know little love won't let us down. But, I feel bad, you know?
宋喬(sadness): 你以爲只有你一個人心裏難受啊？小愛沒辦法上高中，你以爲我這個當媽的心裏就好受嗎？啊？現在，除了這樣，你還有別的辦法嗎？
Do you think you're the only one who can't go to high school? Do you think it's easy for me to be a mother? Now, is there anything else you can do?
張一榮(sadness): 是，我知道是我沒用！是我對不起你，對不起小愛！
Yes, I know I'm useless! I'm sorry, love!
宋喬(sadness): 行了，你別這樣自責了。再自責也沒用不是嗎？現在最重要的是要讓阿心好好學習，不要辜負了小愛，這纔是最重要的，不然，這纔是真的對不起小愛。
Come on, don't blame yourself. There's no point in blaming yourself. Now it's important that Ken learn and don't give up on love. That's the most important thing. Otherwise, I'm really sorry about love.
張一榮(happiness): 對！現在就是要讓阿心好好學習，這樣纔不枉小愛的苦心。
Yes, now it's time for Ken to learn, so it's not for love's sake.
宋喬(sadness): 還有，不能讓阿心知道小愛是爲了她纔去上技校的。不然，又不知道會出什麼亂子。現在，我真的經不起任何折騰了。我的心痛死了！我的小愛。
And Oshin cannot know that she went to technical school for her. No, I do not know what will happen to her. Now, I really cannot afford anything. My heart hurts to death, my love.
張一榮(happiness): 這個我知道，我們把這個就當是個祕密一直保守下去吧！等到阿心大學畢業了，有出息了，再把這個告訴她，讓她好好報答她的姐姐。
I know, let's take this as a secret and keep it a secret. When Ken's college is finished and he's done well, tell her this and let her repay her sister.
宋喬(sadness): 我倒不圖她怎麼報答，只希望她們兩姐妹能好好相處，快快樂樂的就是我最大的心願了。
I don't want her to repay her. I just want them to get along. Happy is my best wish.
張一榮(happiness): 放心吧！小愛這麼好的姐姐，阿心怎麼會捨得。
Don't worry, you're such a good sister, how can you give up?
宋喬(sadness): 好了，你也別這樣了，面對現實吧！
All right, you too. Face it!
張一榮(happiness): 謝謝你，老婆！
Thank you, honey!
宋喬(happiness): 真肉麻！
That's disgusting!

Get out of here, please! Now! Now!
張心(angry): 我還就偏不出去！你能把我怎麼的？
I can't get out of here. What can you do to me?
宋喬(angry): 行啦！都別吵了！能不能消停一下，啊？

Why are you talking like that? Your sister just asked you a question?

Xin told me something, but he hasn't come back yet! It's so urgent!
張一榮(neutral): 打個電話問一下嘛！
Let's make a phone call.
宋喬(fear): 打了打了！都打了好多遍了，沒人接。
I've called him many times. No answer.
張一榮(neutral): 她都那麼大的人了，你就放心吧！去睡吧！
She's so big, don't worry, go to sleep!
宋喬(fear): 可我還是放心不下！小愛已經下落不明瞭，我可不想阿心再。
But I can't help it! I don't want Ashin to know anymore!
張一榮(disgust): 行啦行啦！沒事也被你唸叨出事了！她不是說朋友有事嘛？應該在朋友家裏，沒事的！去睡吧！
Come on, you're talking about everything. She's talking about friends. It's okay. Go to sleep.

柯婕妤(neutral): 傻男人，我們把其他新人丟在了酒店，是不是太不夠意思了？
Silly man, isn't it too bad we left the other new guys at the hotel?
鄺野(happiness): 美麗的紫玫瑰花圃，只能是傻男人和傻女人的結婚天堂。閒雜人一律不能踏足半步。
A beautiful purple rose garden can only be a wedding paradise for stupid men and women. No one can take half a step.
柯婕妤(happiness): 傻男人，到此時我才知道你竟是一個霸權主義者。你可別忘了，他們之中有愛了你多年的女人呢，還有與你同甘共苦的好兄弟呢。
Silly men, it is not until then that I know that you are a hegemonic. And remember, among them are women who have loved you for many years, and good brothers who have suffered with you.
鄺野(happiness): 也還有深愛了你多年的男人呢。哼哼……柯婕妤，今天是我們倆的大婚之日，你心裏可不能想着別的男人噢。
And there's a man who's loved you for years. Uh-huh. Today's our wedding day. You can't think about another man.
柯婕妤(happiness): 我哪有想着別的男人了？我滿腦子全部裝的是你這個傻男人鄺野呢。不過我此刻卻是在想着那古靈精怪的小丫頭呢！她看不見我們倆一定快哭了吧！
What do I think of other men? All I think about is you, stupid man. But I'm thinking about that little girl of the Grinch. She must be crying if she can't see us.
鄺野(neutral): 所以說當父母有事時，獨留孩子還真是過意不去呢。
So it's a shame to leave a child alone when parents have something to do with it.
柯婕妤(neutral): 那你說怎麼辦？要不我們現在、就回去？
What do you say we go back now?
鄺野(neutral): 依你柯婕妤的聰慧，難道還想不出辦法嗎？
Can't you think of a way?
柯婕妤(happiness): 我的確是聰慧。不過自從遇見你這個大名鼎鼎的浩瀚後就變得很笨了。
Indeed, I have been wise, but I have become very stupid since I met you, the famous one.
鄺野(neutral): 唉……看來這個辦法還是由我來想好了。
It seems I'm the one who's got it figured out.
柯婕妤(surprise): 傻男人，你幹嗎撕我婚紗啊？
Silly man, why are you tearing my wedding dress?
鄺野(happiness): 你不覺得兮兒太孤單了嗎？所以我的辦法就是我們倆再爲她生幾個弟弟妹妹陪她玩......
Don't you think it's too lonely? So the only way I can do this is for you and me to give her a few more brothers and sisters and play with her...
柯婕妤(surprise): 就算要爲兮兒再生弟弟妹妹，可你也不該撕碎我的婚紗啊！它可是你媽媽送我的啊！
You shouldn't tear my wedding dress apart even if it's for the rebirth of your brother and sister! Your mother gave it to me!
鄺野(happiness): 我麗芸媽媽的鈔票多如牛毛，她是不會在乎這麼一條十幾萬塊錢的婚紗。何況你又不會再嫁人了，留它也沒有用了是不是？
My mother's money is so hairy that she doesn't care about a 100,000-dollar wedding dress. Besides, you're not getting married again. Is it useless to keep it?
柯婕妤(disgust): 噢……鄺野，你怎麼能這樣啊？真想不到青城市大名鼎鼎的浩瀚竟會是一個敗家子。我明天就把這件事發在微博上讓你的讀者指責你。
Oh, Oshino, how could you do that? I can't believe that the big, famous city of Green City is a loser. I'll put this on Twitter tomorrow and let your readers blame you.
$$$$$

鄺野(neutral): 你說完了嗎？
Are you done?
柯婕妤(neutral): 鈔票來之不易，你……
Money is hard to come by, you...
鄺野(neutral): 看來不找點事情做，你一定會沒完沒了的說下去。
If you don't find something to do, you're going to have to keep talking.
鄺野(happiness): 以後你爲兮兒生弟弟妹妹時，我一定會陪在你身邊！再也不會讓你像獨自生兮兒那麼孤獨與惶惶不安了！
I'll stay with you when you have a brother and a sister. I won't let you be so lonely and scared anymore!

郭章建(happiness): 人的運氣要是來了，你想擋都擋不住啊。
If you're lucky, you can't stop it.
張萌(surprise): 噢？
Huh?
郭章建(happiness): 你不是總說我不學無術嗎？你看看這是什麼？
Didn't you always say I didn't learn anything? Look what this is?
張萌(surprise): 《美國石油生產成本分析》，這是你寫的？
"Analysis of the cost of oil production in the United States." Did you write that?
郭章建(happiness): 不是我寫的上面的作者怎麼會有我的名字？小意思，這不算什麼。再過幾天我還會有一篇更好的文章發表的。
It's not that I wrote my name on it. It's not a big deal. I'll have a better article in a few days.
張萌(surprise): 原來你真有幾下子。我以前怎麼就沒有看出來呢？我……。
So how many times have you been doing this? Why didn't I see it before? I...
郭章建(happiness): 我以前就說過多少次。人啊，千萬不要把別人一下給看扁了。人這一生，三十年河東四十年河西的時候多了。誰知道誰以後會怎麼樣？
How many times have I told you before? Man, don't let anyone else get away with it. It's been more than 30 years, 40 years. Who knows who's going to get away with it?
張萌(disgust): 喂。……。找老郭啊。……。好的，請等一下。又是這個姓陳的女人。討厭。
Hey, look for Guo. Okay, wait a minute. It's this Chan woman again. I hate it.

Qin Yin! Qin Yin!
楊藍(surprise): 你在想什麼呢？我都叫你幾聲了你都沒聽見。
What are you thinking? I told you a few times you didn't hear me.
秦延(neutral): 哦！那個我去給鄺野拿外套時，在他電腦上看見了一個叫夢的網友和他的聊天內容。
Oh, when I went to get a coat for Tanino, I saw on his computer a guy called Dream and his chats.
楊藍(neutral): 夢？應該是個女的吧！你用這種語氣說話，難道他網戀了？
Dreams? It's a woman. Do you speak in that tone, he's in love?
秦延(neutral): 鄺野未婚，倘若是網戀倒沒什麼大不了的事！其實夢就是柯婕妤！我看了他們以前的聊天記錄。一個是‘夢’一個是‘浩瀚’。顯然他們並不知道對方的真實姓名。夢只是找浩瀚指導她寫作。
It's not a big deal if it's a net, but it's a dream. I read their conversation records. One is a dream, and one is a huge dream. Obviously, they don't know the real name of each other. The dream is just a huge guide to her writing.
楊藍(neutral): 我還以爲鄺野網戀了呢！再說柯婕妤就是夢也不值得你一副奇怪的
I thought you weren't supposed to have a dream.
楊藍(disgust): 你賣什麼關子呀？有什麼快點說啊！
What are you selling? Tell me!
$$$$$

秦延(neutral): 昨晚夢一定是想把壓抑在心中的傷心往事講出來。結果她並不知道浩瀚就是鄺野。所以鄺野知道了她的過去後才那麼晚跑去找她！
Last night's dream must have been to speak of the sad past that was crushed in her heart. She didn't know that the vastness of her life was the Tanino. That's why Tanino ran to her at such a late hour.
楊藍(neutral): 柯婕妤的過去究竟是怎麼樣的？
What's the history of Corinne?
秦延(neutral): 柯婕妤不是何叔和黃姨的親生女兒……
Kiryu is not Uncle Ho's and Auntie Wong's biological daughter.

柯婕妤(angry): 何志靜，你也太過分了吧！一去就是兩個多小時。而且連電話也不打一個。這裏離旅店也就十幾分鐘的路程而已。送點湯也需要花那麼長的時間嗎？一定是聊天把我給忘到了九霄雲外。如果你也陷進去了，那個人對你又無意，那多傷你的心啊！真是的！要不要打電話催催她？
Ho Chi Jing, you've gone too far. It's only two hours, and you don't even call. It's only a dozen minutes away from the hotel. Does it take so long to deliver soup? It must have been a chat that left me out of the Nine Clouds. If you're caught up in it, the man doesn't care about you, so it hurts your heart. Do you really want to call her?
何志靜(neutral): 婕妤，等不及了吧！
Can't wait!
柯婕妤(angry): 你也真是的，讓我等了兩個多小時。太……
You've been waiting for me for over two hours, too.
何志靜(neutral): 耽擱了兩個多小時也不是我的錯。他和朋友出去吃飯了，我只有在旅店等着。
It's not my fault it took more than two hours. He went out to dinner with a friend, and I waited at the hotel.
柯婕妤(angry): 你不會來個電話告訴我啊？或者放在總檯請別人轉交也行啊！幹嗎要……
You don't want to call me? Or ask someone to turn it over at the counter. Why?
何志靜(neutral): 那怎麼行？老孃交代要親手送到他手裏。
How is that possible? The old man told him to deliver it to him with his own hands.
何志靜(neutral): 婕妤，你也知道老孃這個人吧，把他看得和我們一樣重要。
You know the old man. He's as important as us.
柯婕妤(neutral): 你可以回旅店了。
You can go back to the hotel now.
柯婕妤(disgust): 快走！看見你就心煩！
Go, I'm upset to see you!

Don't bother. Do we know each other from outside?
鄺野(neutral): 我知道你們閉上眼睛也能走回家。但你們是女孩子，走夜路很不安全！
I know you can walk home with your eyes closed, but you're girls. It's not safe to walk at night!
柯婕妤(angry): 無賴！
Scoundrel!
何志靜(angry): 婕妤，鄺野也是好心！他擔心我們嘛。你說話友善點不行嗎？
He's worried about us. Can't you be nice?
柯婕妤(angry): 何志靜，你閉嘴！
Ho Chi Jing, shut up!
鄺野(angry): 柯婕妤，你有氣衝我發。幹嗎要發在何志靜身上？
Ko-jung, you're mad at me. Why do you want to do it on Ho Chi-jung?
柯婕妤(angry): 志靜，你一定要離他遠點！否則終有一天你會受到傷害！
Ji Jing, you must stay away from him or you'll be hurt one day!
鄺野(angry): 哼！柯婕妤，你還真當我是蛇蠍了？何志靜，別理她！我們走！她有毛病！
You really think I'm a snake? Leave her alone! Let's go! What's wrong with her!
柯婕妤(angry): 你纔是真正的有毛病！你若是沒毛病會跑到這陌生的地方來做無聊的事嗎？你若是沒毛病會無緣無故的認乾媽嗎？你若是沒毛病會大熱天的去送與自己無利益的花嗎？我看你不止是有毛病並且是病入膏肓了！
What is wrong with you is that you will come to this strange place to do boring things if you are not sick. What is wrong with you if you are not sick, and you will think God-mothers for no reason? Would you send flowers that have no benefit to you if you are not? I see you are not only sick, but you are sick.

Mom, he went yesterday to buy cattle for the production team, and I went to the rags and I had no money. And I said I had no conscience for him. That's why we had a fight!
徐父(surprise): 我不信。正鵬不讓你去扯布，一定有他的理由；說你對他沒有良心肯定有事實！
I don't believe it. He won't let you do it. There must be a reason for him to say that you have no conscience for him.
徐母(neutral): 好啦！就別問她那麼多了。既然閨女回了孃家就讓她多住上幾天消消氣也好。世上哪有夫妻倆不吵架的事。反正孃家就是女兒的“根據地”。
Well, don't ask her that much. Since she's gone home, let her stay for a few more days. There are no couples in the world who don't fight. The family is the daughter's "land of origin."

Jung-ho, you're such a fool. I've told you so much, you don't know what it means.
左正鵬(disgust): 劉豔，我曾經跟你講過多少次，你就是不聽，像這樣做真是對不起我的妻子，你懂嗎？求求你趕快放開我行嗎？魯媛走了，我們應爲她節哀纔是，你還樂觀什麼？
How many times have I told you before that you wouldn't listen, like I'm sorry for my wife. Do you understand? Please let go of me. When she leaves, we shall mourn her. What are you so happy about?

What's wrong? Am I right?
宋喬(angry): 對！非常對！那既然知道每個人的脾氣都不一樣，那爲什麼就不能理解自己女兒的脾氣呢？
Why can't you understand your daughter's temper, knowing that everyone's temper is different?
張一榮(angry): 怎麼理解？她那不叫脾氣，那叫無理取鬧，不可理喻！
How do you understand? She's not temper. It's nonsense.
宋喬(neutral): 行了行了！來把湯喝了吧。
Come on, let's drink some soup.
