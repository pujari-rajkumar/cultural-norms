Is there an argument going on? Let’s think about this logically.

Is there an argument going on? Let’s think about this logically.

First, we know that Zhang Xin’s drawer was gone through because she says so. She noticed that it was messed up and asked her father if he did it.

Second, Zhang Yirong denies doing it. He says he doesn’t know why she would think that and he doesn’t know what she’s talking about.

So, we can reasonably conclude that there is an argument going on here. Zhang Xin is accusing her father of going through her drawer, and he is denying it.
